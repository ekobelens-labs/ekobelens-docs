    Securely authenticate, explore DRAM operations, and manage organizations with a consistent
    set of REST endpoints. This guide highlights the essentials so you can move from setup to
    production quickly.
  </p>
</div>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and Yarn for previewing documentation locally (`yarn install && yarn start`).
- An Ekobelens workspace with an administrator or integration user.
- HTTPS enabled in your environment to keep token exchanges secure.

:::tip Credential hygiene
Create a dedicated service account for automation and restrict its permissions to the APIs it needs.

## Environment URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
| --- | --- |
| Production | `https://api.ekobelens.com/v1` |
| Staging | `https://api-stg.ekobelens.com/v1` |

All endpoints listed in the reference are relative to the base URL you target.

## Authenticate in three steps

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL" default>

  ```bash
  # 1. Exchange credentials for an access/refresh token pair
  curl -X POST \
    "$BASE_URL/auth/login" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "your-strong-password"
    }'

  # 2. Call a protected resource with the bearer token
  curl \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    "$BASE_URL/organization"

  # 3. Refresh tokens before the access token expires
  curl -X POST \
    "$BASE_URL/auth/refresh" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "refresh_token": "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
    }'
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">

  ```bash
  http POST "$BASE_URL/auth/login" email=user@example.com password=your-strong-password
  http GET "$BASE_URL/organization" "Authorization:Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
  http POST "$BASE_URL/auth/refresh" refresh_token=<REFRESH_TOKEN>
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Successful responses wrap data in an envelope:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "access_token": "<ACCESS_TOKEN>",
    "refresh_token": "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
  },
  "request_id": "01J..."
}
```

Errors follow a consistent `apperror.Error` shape with `issues` describing validation failures.

## Platform conventions

- All payloads use `application/json` with snake_case fields.
- Idempotent operations return the same `request_id` header you can log for traceability.
- Rate limiting is enforced per workspace; retry after the window resets when you receive HTTP 429.
- Official SDKs stream soonâ€”meanwhile, rely on the OpenAPI definition (`yarn regen-api`) to scaffold clients.

:::note Testing checklist
Before opening a pull request, run `yarn typecheck`, `yarn regen-api`, and `yarn build` to catch MDX or schema issues early.

## Where to next

- Dive into the **API Reference** overview for endpoint groups and schema exports.
- Review **Authentication** endpoints to explore login, token refresh, and session lifetimes.
- Visit **DRAM Lifecycle** docs to learn how chapters map to Mitigation Action Plan workflows.
